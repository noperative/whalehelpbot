You can find the full quest list [here](http://en.kancollewiki.net/wiki/Quests).

""",
    'beginner_dev/cons': """
You can find detailed lists of development recipes [here](http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Development).
There are also construction recipes [here](http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Construction).

Some recipes to try are **10/30/10/31** which gives anti-submarine gear for training at 1-5 and **20/60/10/110** which is a recipe that gives all sorts of carrier-based planes.

Some nice constructions to try if you want to get some stronger ships are:

* **250/30/200/30** for submarines, rare destroyers/light cruisers and heavy cruisers
* **300/30/400/300** for carriers(rare) and light carriers
* **400/100/600/30** for battleships and rare heavy cruisers
